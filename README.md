# droprate
This package can be used to analyse interval data with missed event observations. I developed it for analysing goose faecal dropping rates. Event intervals are fitted to a distribution that accounts for missed observations, calculating the mean and standard deviation of rate of events.

###Installation in R
```
library(devtools)
install_github("adokter/droprate")
```
